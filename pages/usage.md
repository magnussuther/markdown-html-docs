# Usage

Markdown-HTML is a simple creature.

1) Download the index.html (TODO link this) page to your project working directory
2) Edit the index.html page by ...
    - setting a new `<title>`
    - defining your Markdown documents in the PAGES variable.

3) Upload to a webserver, or just use Github Pages.

Thats all.
